title: System Reliability with Error Budgets
description: An error budget is an essential practice for balancing innovation with reliability. By establishing clear SLOs, monitoring performance, and using the error budget as a decision-making tool, organizations can make informed choices about feature development and system maintenance. Implementing this approach requires collaboration and an ongoing commitment to evaluating and adjusting the strategy to meet evolving business needs and user expectations.

# Navigating Reliability: Understanding and Implementing Error Budgets

In today's fast-paced digital environment, organizations consistently strive to balance feature velocity and system reliability. An effective tool that helps achieve this balance is the concept of an "error budget." This blog post will explore what an error budget is, its significance, and provide a step-by-step guide to implementing it effectively within your organization.

## What is an Error Budget?

An error budget is a quantified amount of acceptable unreliability. It represents the difference between 100% system reliability and the reliability target defined through Service Level Objectives (SLOs). In other words, if your SLO is 99.9% uptime, your error budget is the remaining 0.1% of downtime that’s permissible within a defined period.

## Why Use an Error Budget?

Error budgets play a crucial role in balancing innovation and stability. They:

- Enhance focus on reliability by making the allowable risk of system degradation explicit.
- Provide teams with a clear metric on when to push forward with new features or when to spend time addressing system stability issues.
- Encourage a culture of shared responsibility across development, operations, and business teams for maintaining system performance.

## Steps to Implement an Error Budget

### 1. Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

Start by clearly defining your SLOs, which should be measurable and realistic. SLOs are key in determining what parts of the system should be reliable and to what extent. Consider factors like user expectations, historical data, and business priorities while defining them.

### 2. Establish your Error Budget

Once SLOs are in place, calculate your error budget. This involves deciding on the acceptable downtime or failure rate. For example, if your SLO is 99.9% uptime, your error budget would equate to roughly 8.76 hours of downtime annually.

### 3. Monitor and Measure Performance

Implement robust monitoring tools that provide real-time data on system performance relative to your SLOs. This data helps track the consumption of your error budget and identify trends or anomalies in system reliability.

### 4. Implement Feedback Loops

Create feedback mechanisms where information about error budget consumption is regularly reviewed by both technical and business teams. This helps in making timely decisions about feature releases and prioritization of reliability improvements.

### 5. Govern Release Decisions

Use the error budget as a governance tool for making release decisions. If the error budget is consumed rapidly, focus should shift from deploying new features to investing in system reliability. Conversely, if the error budget is being consistently underutilized, it indicates room for accelerating innovation and feature launches.

### 6. Review and Adjust Periodically

Regularly review your SLOs and error budgets to ensure they align with changing business goals and user expectations. Adjust them as necessary based on feedback and historical data analysis.

### 7. Foster a Culture of Collaboration

Encourage collaboration across your development and operations teams. An error budget encourages shared goals and promotes understanding of the trade-offs between speed and reliability.

## AWS Integrations

### AWS Trusted Advisor

Use AWS Trusted Advisor to gain insights into best practices and potential improvements on AWS that support better reliability.

### AWS Service Health Dashboard

Regularly monitor the AWS Service Health Dashboard to be aware of any AWS service outages affecting your application’s reliability.

By integrating AWS services with the concept of error budgeting, you can effectively manage and optimize the resilience and performance of your applications, ensuring they meet user expectations while allowing room for innovation and growth.
